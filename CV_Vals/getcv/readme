This is an IDL code to compute the cosmic variance as a function of
survey geometry, mean redshift, redshift bin size and stellar mass

The main program is getcv.pro
Enter the parameters (angular dimensions of survey and redshift bins)
and run getcv to get a table containing the cosmic variance for 6 stellar
mass bins.
